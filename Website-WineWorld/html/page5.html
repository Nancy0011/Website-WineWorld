	<h4>With 65 wine regions across the country, Australian wine is as varied as it is sophisticated. Max Allen takes us through everything you need to know about the local wine industry.</h4>
	<p>There’s so much going on in Australian wine at the moment it can be exhausting keeping up with it all. I’ve been immersed in the local booze scene here for 25 years, and I can’t remember a time when things have been so dynamic and so exciting – when there’s been such a seemingly inexhaustible stream of new labels from adventurous producers exploring new grape varieties and innovative new styles. That said, it’s not all about novelty: there’s also a burgeoning sense of respect for the best of the well-established regions, vineyards and grapes, with a younger generation exploring their forbears’ familiar surroundings and helping us see things anew. </p>
	<h4>Ancient vines, ancient wines </h4>

	<h5>Seppeltsfield Wines, Barossa Valley, South Australia</h5>
	<br>
	<p>In many ways, Australia is a very new wine country: most of the 2,500-plus wine producers and 130,000 hectares of vines were only established in the last 20 or 30 years. But Australia is also home to some of the oldest vineyard soils, the oldest vines, the oldest wineries and the oldest stocks of slowly maturing wines in the world.</p>
	<p>In ’s Barossa Valley, Dean  makes a deeply savoury, earthy red called Old Garden from mourvèdre vines planted in the 1840s, while the oldest vines at ’s famous Hill of Grace vineyard, in the neighbouring Eden Valley, date back to 1860. And down the road at  (established in 1851), winemaker Fiona Donald is custodian of a unique collection of barrels of vintage-dated tawny “ports”, dating back to the 1870s, most of which are, remarkably, available for purchase: a 100ml bottle of the 1880, for example, can be yours for a mere $2,450 (US$1,860)...</p>
	<h4>Spice of life</h4>

	<h5>McLaren Vale wine region, Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia</h5>
	<p>Every wine drinker around the world is familiar with Australia’s sunshine-in-a-glass chardonnay and shiraz, and while those two varieties certainly dominate the overall vineyard area, more than 150 other cultivars are also now grown across this wide brown land. These range from recent plantings of the Greek white assyrtiko to well-established plantings of the Californian red zinfandel and almost every letter of the varietal alphabet in-between.</p> 
	<h4>Less is more</h4><br>

	<h5>Grape fermentation, McLaren Vale, Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia</h5>
	<p>Australia is at the forefront of the natural/lo-fi/minimal-intervention movement sweeping through the wine world – surprising, perhaps, in a country that has prided itself on its cutting-edge scientific winemaking breakthroughs and its clean, correct, technical winemaking over the decades.</p>
